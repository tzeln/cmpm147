				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This world expands infinitely in all directions. Variation in space comes with alterations in height, color, opacity, and depth.
					Variations in key remain consistent. Boxes are animated to give a reflection of "life".
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I utilize a combination of procedural generation algorithms to create a dynamically evolving 
					virtual landscape. The core of the experiment lies in the unique hash value generated from user interactions seeds the procedural algorithms. 
					Using the XXH32 hashing function and p5.js's built-in noiseSeed and randomSeed methods, each 
					input generates a distinct visual output on a grid of tiles. Each tile, depending on its hashed 
					value, displays different shades and volumes. Additionally, there's animation on each box to imitate some sort of variability between states. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working on this was mainly me figuring out what the functions did and how they interacted with each other. I'm unsure how much I truly contributed,
					but it surprisingly probably only adds up to a couple lines here and there. Amanda and I worked on our own individual project first and then shared
					a submission where we worked on something together, so I'd say our contributions to the project are very similar.
